1. Unit Groups and Loading Units

First off, you want to learn how to define a unit within a group.

	UNIT UnitID ClassID Leader Level(Lv,Faction,Autolevel) [X,Y] ItemDrop 0 REDACount REDAList [Item1,Item2,Item3,Item4] AI

UnitID corresponds to the Unit's ID in the character table.

ClassID corresponds to the class ID in the class table.

Leader corresponds to the unit's group leader. This is exclusively used for leader AI in enemy units.

Lv corresponds to the unit's level.

Faction corresponds to the unit's faction. Ally for blue units, Enemy for red units, and NPC for green units.

Autolevel is set to 1 for autolevel and 0 for static level. Static level will load the unit with stats defined only by character and class bases. Autolevel will apply level ups based on class growth rates.

[X,Y] corresponds to the unit's spawn coordinates.

ItemDrop is set to 2 for a droppable item (highlighted in green) and 0 otherwise.

REDACount corresponds to the number of REDAs to be used.

REDAList corresponds to the list of REDAs to be used. REDAs define unit movement immediately after loading - see more information below.

[Item1...] corresponds to the unit's inventory. Note that units can only spawn with a maximum of 4 items. Each item ID refers to the item within the item table.

AI corresponds to the unit's AI. Only used for non-Ally units.

Example:

	UNIT Eirika EirikaLord 0x0 Level(1,Ally,0) [1,2] 0 0 0 0 [Rapier,Vulnerary] NoAI

When you create a unit group, you need to define a label name, and also have a blank UNIT at the end.

	SampleUnitGroup:
	UNIT Eirika EirikaLord 0x0 Level(1,Ally,0) [1,2] 0 0 0 0 [Rapier,Vulnerary] NoAI
	UNIT Seth Paladin 0x0 Level(1,Ally,0) [2,2] 0 0 0 0 [SilverLance,SteelSword] NoAI
	UNIT

Unit groups can contain several units, as the name implies.
There are several ways to load your unit group.

Use LOAD1 and ENUN when the group is being loaded for the first time (a unit's first appearence or an enemy unit).

	LOAD1 0x1 SampleUnitGroup
	ENUN

Use LOAD2 and ENUN when the group is not being loaded for the first time (returning party members).

	LOAD2 0x1 SampleUnitGroup
	ENUN



1.1 Using REDAs

Usually when you spawn reinforcements you want them to come from a logical location and then move into a new position. You can achieve this using REDAs. Defining one is as follows.

	SampleREDA:
	REDA [1,2] 0 0 0 0

Note the values in the square brackets correspond to x and y coordinates, [x,y].
Then you just need to assign it to your unit.

	UNIT EnemyUnit Fighter EnemyBoss Level(1,Enemy,1) [3,4] 0 0 1 SampleREDA [IronAxe] AttackInRangeAI

As you can see, the number of REDAs is set to 1, and the SampleREDA is set to this unit.
Note that they will move to the location in the REDA and from the location defined as a UNIT.
In this case, the unit will spawn at [3,4] and move to [1,2].
